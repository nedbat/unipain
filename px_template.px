<p>This is a presentation I gave at PyCon 2012.
You can read the slides and text on this page, or open the <a href='text/unipain/unipain.html'>actual presentation</a> in your browser,
or watch the video:</p>

<p>Also, clicking the slide images will jump into the full presentation at that point.
The Symbola font is included, but will have to be downloaded before some of the
special symbols will appear.</p>
